# ANALYSIS-OF-ROAD-ACCIDENTS-USING-DATA-VISUALIZATION-TECHNIQUES
## 1. INTRODUCTION
### 1.1 ABSTRACT
<br>
Roadway traffic safety is a major concern for transportation governing agencies as well as
ordinary citizens. In order to give safe driving suggestions, careful analysis of roadway traffic
data is critical to find out variables that are closely related to fatal accidents. The relationship
between fatal rate and other attributes including collision manner, weather, surface condition,
causality severity, and driver age were investigated.
</br>
Association rules were discovered by Apriori algorithm, classification model was built by Naive
Bayes classifier, and clusters were formed by a simple K-means clustering algorithm. Certain
safety driving suggestions were made based on statistics, association rules, classification model,
and clusters obtained.

<h3>1.2 INTRODUCTION</h3>
<br>
Investigations of the high-risk areas for road traffic crashes (RTCs) are urgently needed to guide
improvements in road safety. In this paper we apply statistics analysis and data visualisation
algorithms on the FARS Fatal Accident dataset as an attempt to address this problem. In this
paper, the relationship between fatality rate and other attributes including collision manner,
weather, surface condition, causality severity, and driver age were investigated.

<h3> 1.3 OBJECTIVE</h3>
<br>
● Our Objective is to arrive at a conclusion regarding the problem of Roadway traffic safety and to give safe driving suggestions.</br>
● Finding Numbers of accidents happening in rural and urban areas.</br>
● Finding the trend in the number of accidents that occur each year.</br>
● Finding the most dangerous time to drive.</br>
● Finding What fraction of accidents caused minor injuries , major injuries and deaths.</br>
● Finding how fast the number of car accidents drop off with age.</br>
● Finding the ratio of men and women who get injured in accidents.</br>
<br>
<h3>2. PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
<br>
Roadway traffic safety is a major concern for transportation governing agencies as well as
ordinary citizens. In order to give safe driving suggestions, careful analysis of roadway traffic
data is critical to find out variables that are closely related to fatal accidents. India is a country
having a high usage of vehicles. The vehicle consumption has drastically increased in the last 40
years from 6 million to 230 million vehicles. Due to the increasing rate of 9% vehicles per year,
the occurrence of road accidents has increased exponentially which in turn has hampered the
road security of the people in India.
